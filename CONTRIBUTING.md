## Issues

Feel free to [make an issue](https://github.com/Calebh101/About-This-PC/issues/new/choose) on anything - even things like feature requests or tiny bugs. Just know that I might not get around to much, like if a certain bug only happens on an obscure Linux distro, then I might not feel it's necessary to fix it. If you *really* want something implemented, consider [making a pull request](https://github.com/Calebh101/About-This-PC?tab=contributing-ov-file#pull-requests).

Also, if you actually do something with the code or other things such as assets or documentation, please make a pull request instead of an issue, so you can be recognized as a contributor.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are bug fixes or feature implementations that are submitted by the community instead of implemented by the creators of the project. Pull requests aren't always submitted and done, sometimes there might be small (or big) improvements to make to a pull request.

When you [make a pull request](https://github.com/Calebh101/About-This-PC/compare), make sure that:

- If it's not platform-specific, it'd be nice to have it implemented for all platforms
- That it's properly tested (I'll also do some testing)
- And that it's implemented properly. I don't want some weird hacky fix to something that could be done much simpler, or a feature that doesn't respect the user. (This is why automatic update checking is *off* by default.)

## Donating

If you feel obliged to donate to me or the project, just don't; go put that money towards a reputable charity instead.
